# Pinata CLI
## What is Pinata Cloud?
Pinata Cloud is a SaaS platform that provides infrastructure to manage your files and other data using the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) network. Pinata aims to provide IPFS services to a wider range of users by offering tools to:

- Pin Files: Ensuring that they remain accessible and stored across the IPFS network.
- File Storage: A File API that is simpler than S3, lightning fast, and highly durable.
- Serve IPFS Content: Offering reliable gateways to make decentralized content accessible through traditional web browsers.
- Automate Workflows: Facilitating workflows related to content distribution, making it popular for NFT (Non-Fungible Token) projects, where digital assets need decentralized and permanent hosting.

Pinata offers both free and paid tiers, with the paid version providing more storage, faster pinning, and enhanced performance options. Itâ€™s widely used in decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and by anyone looking to leverage the distributed nature of IPFS for content storage and delivery.
